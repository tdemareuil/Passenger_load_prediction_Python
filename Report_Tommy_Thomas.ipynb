As we could not keep 2 separated files, we just **concatenated** our data per flight route next to the rest of the data (using the `pd.concat`function), to produce a final `external_data` file."

This could help them **allocate planes** (e.g. schedule more flights on highly-frequented routes), or tune their **pricing policy** (increase ticket prices on highly-frequented routes). Indirectly, it could also help them adjust their **resource management**, by allocating more resources (investments, additional staff, etc.) to the routes with the highest passenger load.\n",
